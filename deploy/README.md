# EC2 Deployment Guide

This directory contains automated deployment scripts for setting up the Drone Crop Health Platform on AWS EC2.

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Connect to EC2 and Transfer Files

From your local machine, run:

```bash
# Make sure your key file is in the current directory or specify the path
chmod 400 id_rsa

# Transfer deployment files to EC2
scp -i id_rsa -r deploy/ ec2-user@ec2-18-224-7-31.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:~/
```

### Step 2: Run Setup Script on EC2

SSH into your EC2 instance:

```bash
ssh -i id_rsa ec2-user@ec2-18-224-7-31.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com
```

Then run:

```bash
chmod +x ~/deploy/ec2-setup.sh
~/deploy/ec2-setup.sh
```

### Step 3: Configure Environment Variables

After the script completes, edit the environment files:

```bash
nano ~/Capstone_Interface/server/.env
nano ~/Capstone_Interface/python_processing/.env
```

### Step 4: Restart Services

```bash
pm2 restart all
pm2 status
```
